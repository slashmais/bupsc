bupsc ("bahp-see":) is a real-time deep cumulative backup utility for directories.
It is a fire-&-forget-utility until you need to recover work.

The purpose is for full, deep backup of source directories to one or more
backup-dirs (on preferably other devices) in real-time, as you work.
You tell it the work(source) and the backups(destinations) directories
and it will do the rest including full initial deep copy of the work-dir,
and as you work it will mirror the work-dir structure and content in
real-time.

bupsc runs as a deamon, and ideally should be auto-started. 

1. Need the following libraries:
	libsqlite3
	libz

2. bupsc uses the experimental version of "filesystem". If you 
   have C++17, you need to edit 'utilfuncs.cpp' where indicated.

3. Use the following commands to compile bupsc:
	make clean
	make
   This will create bupsc-application. Copy bupsc to a location
   in your PATH and execute it. It will create ~/.config/bupsc
   which will contain the master database. You can edit the content
   of this database directly once you understand how it works,
   otherwise run bupsc --help which will tell you what & how.
